# Pytorch
PyTorch is a machine learning library for Python, the open source software was developed by the artificial intelligence teams at Facebook Inc. in 2016. PyTorch offers two important features including tensor computation, as well as functional deep neural networks.

## Flowers detector
This algorithm allows to model a classifier of 102 different types of flowers. For this case, we import the vgg16 model already pre-trained. This model can detect the type of the flowers only giving a 512x512 image.
